# Autoscaling Mode 3

Configured autoscaling mode. "vertical" runs a fixed replica count while memory scales between minReplicaMemoryGb and maxReplicaMemoryGb; "horizontal" scales the replica count between minReplicas and maxReplicas at a fixed per-replica memory. This is the baseline configuration; the mode currently applied (which may differ while a schedule entry is active) is currentScaling.effectiveAutoscalingMode.
