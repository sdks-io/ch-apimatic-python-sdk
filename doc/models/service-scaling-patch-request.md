# Service Scaling Patch Request

*This model accepts additional fields of type Any.*

## Structure

`ServiceScalingPatchRequest`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `min_total_memory_gb` | `float` | Optional | DEPRECATED - inaccurate for services with non-default numbers of replicas. Use `minReplicaMemoryGb` instead. Minimum memory of three workers during auto-scaling in Gb. Available only for 'production' services. Must be a multiple of 12 and greater than or equal to 24. Always absent for horizontal-autoscaling services (replica count is variable).<br><br>**Constraints**: `>= 24`, `<= 1068`, *Multiple Of*: `12` |
| `max_total_memory_gb` | `float` | Optional | DEPRECATED - inaccurate for services with non-default numbers of replicas. Use `maxReplicaMemoryGb` instead. Maximum memory of three workers during auto-scaling in Gb. Available only for 'production' services. Must be a multiple of 12 and lower than or equal to 360 for non paid services or 1068 for paid services. Always absent for horizontal-autoscaling services (replica count is variable).<br><br>**Constraints**: `>= 24`, `<= 1068`, *Multiple Of*: `12` |
| `num_replicas` | `int` | Optional | Number of replicas for the service. The number of replicas must be between 2 and 50 for the first service in a warehouse. Services that are created in an existing warehouse can have a number of replicas as low as 1. Further restrictions may apply based on your organization's tier and its per-warehouse replica limit. It defaults to 1 for the BASIC tier and 3 for the SCALE and ENTERPRISE tiers.<br><br>**Constraints**: `>= 1`, `<= 50` |
| `idle_scaling` | `bool` | Optional | When set to true the service is allowed to scale down to zero when idle. True by default. |
| `idle_timeout_minutes` | `float` | Optional | Set minimum idling timeout (in minutes). Must be >= 5 minutes. |
| `additional_properties` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Optional | - |

## Example

```python
import jsonpickle

from openapispecforclickhousecloud.models.service_scaling_patch_request import ServiceScalingPatchRequest

service_scaling_patch_request = ServiceScalingPatchRequest(
    min_total_memory_gb=48,
    max_total_memory_gb=360,
    num_replicas=3,
    idle_scaling=False,
    idle_timeout_minutes=177.1,
    additional_properties={
        'exampleAdditionalProperty': jsonpickle.decode('{"key1":"val1","key2":"val2"}')
    }
)
